#BlogMigrator

Simple migration from Tumblr to Wordpress.

##Description.

BlogMigrator is a simple Java program to convert Tumblr JSON files to an XML to import in Wordpress. The JSON files are downloaded calling the [Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2) (query Posts). It then generates a custom XML file which can then be loaded using the plugin [WP All Import](http://www.wpallimport.com).

It may not be usable as is for your blog migration, but you can fork to make your own version.

###Tumblr API

In order to get the JSON file, the query https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/<blog URI>/posts must be run (using a program like the free version of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)).

This query will require to obtain an authentication token.

This query will return 20 posts at the time. In order to get the next 20 posts, use the `offset` parameter:

For example, if there are 75 posts on your Tumblr blog:

  - The first 20: https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/<blog URI>/posts
  - The next 20: https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/<blog URI>/posts?offset=20
  - The next 20: https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/<blog URI>/posts?offset=40
  - The last 15: https://api.tumblr.com/v2/blog/<blog URI>/posts?offset=60
  
You can of course explore the Tumblr API to make the appropriate queries.

###Build and run

Eclipse Photon was used to build and run. There are Maven dependencies.

The program requires only one parameter: the path to the JSON configuration file. For details about this file, please refer to the next section.

###JSON Configuration

This file will have all the parameter to convert the JSON files from Tumblr to an XML file.

	{
		"input_files": [
			"/path/to/tumblr/input/file1.json",
			"/path/to/tumblr/input/file2.json",
			"/path/to/tumblr/input/file3.json",
			"/path/to/tumblr/input/file4.json"
		],
		"output_file": "/path/to/output/file.xml",
		"post_mapping_rules": {
			"import_unmapped": false,
			"map_if_empty_only": false,
			"id-1": {
				"categories": "new, categories",
				"title": "New title 1",
				"slug": "new-title-1"
			},
			"id-2": {
				"categories": "new, categories",
				"title": "New title 2",
				"slug": "new-title-2"
			}
		}
	}

`input_files`: an array of file path to the Tumblr JSON files. They will be processed in this sequence.

`output_file`: the path to the output file.

`post_mapping_rules`: a set of rules to apply during the conversion:
  - `import_unmapped`: if set to `true`, only import a post if there's a specific mapping rule for the post `id`. Else, don't filter the post.
  - `map_if_empty_only`: if set to `true`, only replace a value in a field if this field is originaly empty. Else, the value will be overwritten.
  - `id`: allow to set specific rules for a given post `id`
    - `categories`: the categories to assign to the post (Tumblr doesn't use categories).
    - `title`: the title to assign to the post (Tumblr doesn't use title).
    - `slug`: the slug for the URL (Tumblr uses slug as well).
     
###XML Output and import process

There is no schema (XSD or DTD) for the output XML. It is generated using JAXB. The plugin `WP All Import` doesn't require a fix format, it will allow you to map a custom XML to each object you are trying to load.

##Dependencies

This program requires `JSON-Simple` and `JAXB`.

To build the code, only the following Maven dependencies must be resolved:

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.googlecode.json-simple</groupId>
			<artifactId>json-simple</artifactId>
			<version>1.1.1</version>
		</dependency>
